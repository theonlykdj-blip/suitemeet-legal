      you consent to:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Having your approximate presence (for example, “same hotel” or
        “within radius”) shown to other SuiteMeet users consistent with
        your settings.
      </li>
      <li>
        Appearing in the “Who’s Here” or similar lists for users whose

    </ul>

    <h2>3. Location-Based Features</h2>
    <p>

      <li>Determining whether you are “within radius” of other users.</li>
