    <h1>SuiteMeet – Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: [update this date]</em></p>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how SuiteMeet (“we”, “us”, or “our”) collects, uses, and protects information
      when you use the SuiteMeet mobile application (the “App”).
    </p>

    <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>SuiteMeet is designed to minimize the personal data we collect. Depending on how you use the App, we may collect:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Profile information</strong> such as the display name, short bio, and profile visibility options you choose to provide.</li>
      <li><strong>Location-related information</strong> used to show approximate distance to hotels and other guests within your selected radius. In the current release, this is used on-device for demo/test purposes and is not stored on a remote server by SuiteMeet.</li>
      <li><strong>App preferences</strong> such as dark mode, radius settings, and local profile values stored on your device using local storage (e.g., AsyncStorage).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. How We Use Information</h2>
    <p>We use information you provide only to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Display your chosen profile information to other users according to your visibility settings.</li>
      <li>Show hotels and demo guests within your selected radius.</li>
      <li>Remember your preferences and settings on your device.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Location & Visibility Controls</h2>
    <p>You control whether and how you appear to others:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Share my presence</strong>: toggle visibility on or off from within the App.</li>
      <li><strong>Share my profile with</strong>: choose “None/Private”, “Same hotel”, or “Within radius”.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      If you turn off presence sharing, your current hotel is cleared and you are no longer visible to other users.
    </p>

    <h2>4. Local Storage</h2>
    <p>
      SuiteMeet stores your profile name, bio, visibility setting, and profile photo locally on your device.
      You can reset this data from the Settings screen in the App.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      SuiteMeet is intended for adults aged 18 and older. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 18.
      If you believe a child has used the App and provided information, please contact us so we can review and take appropriate action.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      SuiteMeet may rely on third-party services (such as app stores, crash reporting, or analytics) which are subject to
      their own privacy policies. We encourage you to review those policies to understand how your data is handled by those services.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Security</h2>
    <p>
      We take reasonable steps to protect information processed by the App. However, no method of transmission or storage is
      completely secure, and we cannot guarantee absolute security.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Last updated” date at the top of this page.
      Your continued use of the App after any changes constitutes your acceptance of the revised Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact the developer using the email address listed
      on the SuiteMeet app store listing.
