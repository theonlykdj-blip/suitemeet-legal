    <h1>SuiteMeet Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><strong>Last updated: November 2025</strong></p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the
      <span class="app-name">SuiteMeet</span> mobile application (“App”).
      By installing or using SuiteMeet, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
      If you do not agree, do not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      You must be at least 18 years old to use SuiteMeet. By using the App,
      you represent and warrant that you are 18 or older.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Purpose of SuiteMeet</h2>
    <p>
      SuiteMeet is intended to help adult hotel guests discover and connect
      with other guests staying at the same hotel or nearby hotels within
      a user-selected radius. It is a social and networking tool and does
      not provide transportation, lodging, or other regulated services.
    </p>

    <h2>3. User Responsibilities</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>You are solely responsible for the content you share through the App.</li>
      <li>You agree not to use the App for any illegal, harmful, or harassing activity.</li>
      <li>
        You agree not to send spam, solicitations, or misleading messages to other users.
      </li>
      <li>
        You are responsible for your own safety when meeting or communicating with others.
        Always exercise common sense and caution.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Acceptable Use</h2>
    <p>You agree not to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Upload or share content that is abusive, hateful, threatening, or explicit.</li>
      <li>Impersonate another person or misrepresent your identity.</li>
      <li>
        Attempt to reverse engineer, modify, or interfere with the operation of the App.
      </li>
      <li>Use the App to stalk, harass, or harm any individual.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. No Guarantee of Matches or Availability</h2>
    <p>
      SuiteMeet does not guarantee that you will see other guests, receive responses,
      or successfully connect with anyone. Availability of nearby users depends on
      who is using the App and their chosen visibility settings.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Location and Presence</h2>
    <p>
      If you enable presence sharing and set your radius, the App may show your
      approximate distance and hotel to other users consistent with your profile
      visibility settings. You can turn sharing off at any time.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Local Storage of Data</h2>
    <p>
      Profile information, chats, and certain settings may be stored locally on your
      device. If you uninstall the App or clear its data, this information may be
      removed from your device. For details, see the Privacy Policy.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      SuiteMeet, including its design, branding, and features, is the property of
      the developer. You may not copy, distribute, or create derivative works of
      the App except as allowed by applicable law.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>
      THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY
      KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS OR IMPLIED. WE DO NOT GUARANTEE THAT THE APP WILL
      BE UNINTERRUPTED, ERROR-FREE, OR SECURE.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE ARE NOT LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT,
      INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA,
      PROFITS, OR REPUTATION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO YOUR USE OF THE APP.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Safety and In-Person Meetings</h2>
    <p>
      If you choose to meet someone you connected with through SuiteMeet, you do so
      at your own risk. Consider meeting in public spaces, telling a friend where
      you are going, and following basic safety practices.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms from time to time. When we do, we will update the
      “Last updated” date above. Your continued use of the App after changes are
      posted means you accept the revised Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>13. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We reserve the right to suspend or terminate your access to SuiteMeet if we
      believe you have violated these Terms or used the App in a harmful or
      unlawful way.
    </p>

    <h2>14. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have questions about these Terms, you can contact the developer through
      the app store listing or the GitHub repository where this document is hosted.
