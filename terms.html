    <h1>SuiteMeet – Terms of Service</h1>
    <p><em>Last updated: [update this date]</em></p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the SuiteMeet mobile application (the “App”).
      By downloading, installing, or using SuiteMeet, you agree to be bound by these Terms.
      If you do not agree, do not use the App.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Eligibility</h2>
    <p>
      You must be at least 18 years old to use SuiteMeet. By using the App, you represent and warrant that you
      are at least 18 years of age and capable of entering into a binding agreement.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Purpose of SuiteMeet</h2>
    <p>
      SuiteMeet is intended to help hotel guests discover and connect with other guests within a selected radius.
      The App is for social and informational purposes only and should not be used for any unlawful or unsafe activity.
    </p>

    <h2>3. User Conduct</h2>
    <p>You agree that you will not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Harass, threaten, or abuse other users.</li>
      <li>Post or share content that is illegal, harmful, defamatory, hateful, or sexually explicit.</li>
      <li>Impersonate any person or misrepresent your identity or affiliation.</li>
      <li>Use the App for spamming, solicitation, or commercial advertising without permission.</li>
      <li>Attempt to reverse-engineer, decompile, or otherwise tamper with the App’s code or security.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. No Guarantee of Matches or Availability</h2>
    <p>
      We do not guarantee that you will see other users, receive responses, or form any type of relationship.
      Availability of other users depends on their own settings, usage, and location.
    </p>

    <h2>5. Safety & Your Responsibility</h2>
    <p>
      Any interactions you have with other users are your own responsibility. Use common sense and caution when
      deciding whether to meet anyone in person. We do not screen users, verify identities, or run background checks.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      The App, including its name, logo, design, and content (excluding content you provide), is owned by the developer
      or licensors and is protected by applicable intellectual property laws. You are granted a limited, personal,
      non-exclusive, non-transferable license to use the App solely for its intended purpose.
    </p>

    <h2>7. App Availability & Changes</h2>
    <p>
      We may modify, suspend, or discontinue the App at any time without notice. We may also update these Terms,
      and your continued use of the App after an update means you accept the revised Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
    <p>
      THE APP IS PROVIDED “AS IS” AND “AS AVAILABLE” WITHOUT WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.
      WE DISCLAIM ALL WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, AND NON-INFRINGEMENT.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>
      TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE WILL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,
      CONSEQUENTIAL, OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, OR ANY LOSS OF DATA OR PROFITS, ARISING OUT OF OR IN CONNECTION
      WITH YOUR USE OF THE APP.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Termination</h2>
    <p>
      We may suspend or terminate your access to the App at any time if we believe you have violated these Terms
      or used the App in a harmful or abusive manner.
    </p>

    <h2>11. Governing Law</h2>
    <p>
      These Terms are governed by the laws applicable in your jurisdiction, without regard to conflict-of-law principles.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Contact</h2>
