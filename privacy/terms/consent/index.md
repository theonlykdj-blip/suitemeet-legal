**Effective Date: November 2025**

This Consent Notice explains how SuiteMeet uses certain permissions and features. By continuing to use the App, you consent to the practices described below.

## 1. Location Access

SuiteMeet uses your approximate location (with your permission) to:

- Show demo hotels near you  
- Calculate and display distances to hotels  
- Help determine which users appear within your selected radius  

You can turn location access off at any time in your device settings, but some features may not work as intended.

## 2. Presence Sharing & Visibility

You control whether other users can see you. The App offers different visibility options, such as:

- **Off** – You are not visible to others  
- **Same hotel only** – Visible only to guests at the same hotel  
- **Within radius** – Visible to users within your chosen distance  

You may change these settings at any time in the App.

We do not run a central server that stores your profile or messages.

You may clear local profile data from the App’s Settings screen.
