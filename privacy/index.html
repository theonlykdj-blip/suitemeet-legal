    <h1>SuiteMeet Privacy Policy</h1>
    <div class="meta">Last updated: November 2025</div>

    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how <span class="app-name">SuiteMeet</span> (“we,” “us,” or “our”)
      collects, uses, and protects information when you use the SuiteMeet mobile app.
    </p>

    <h2>1. What SuiteMeet Does</h2>
    <p>
      SuiteMeet is a hotel social app designed to help adult guests discover and connect with
      other guests who are staying at the same hotel or nearby hotels within a chosen radius.
    </p>

    <h2>2. Information We Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Profile information (local only)</strong> – Your display name, short bio, profile
        photo, and visibility preferences are stored <strong>on your device only</strong> using
        local storage. SuiteMeet does not operate a cloud account system.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Location (for Nearby only)</strong> – With your permission, the app uses your
        device’s approximate location to show demo hotel distances and nearby guests. Location
        data is used in-app and not stored on a remote server.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Presence & radius settings</strong> – Your choice to share presence and the miles
        radius you select are stored locally on your device.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Chat messages (local demo)</strong> – In this demo version, hotel and direct
        messages are stored locally on your device for your convenience. There is no remote
        messaging server.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How We Use Your Information</h2>
    <p>We use the information described above to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Show you hotels and approximate distances within your selected radius</li>
      <li>Let you control how visible your profile is to other guests</li>
      <li>Display and manage your in-app chats with hotels and nearby guests</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Data Storage & Retention</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Most data in SuiteMeet is stored locally on your device (profile, chats, preferences).
        If you delete the app or clear its data, that information is removed from your device.
      </li>
      <li>
        We do not maintain a central database of your profile, chats, or location history.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>5. Permissions</h2>
    <p>SuiteMeet may request the following permissions on your device:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Location</strong> – Used to calculate distances to nearby hotels and guests.
        Presence sharing is optional and can be turned off at any time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Photos / Media</strong> – Used only if you choose to select a profile photo from
        your device.
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Network access</strong> – Used for basic connectivity and future backend
        features (such as live hotel data) where available.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Children & Age Requirement</h2>
    <p>
      SuiteMeet is intended for adults age 18 and older. By using the app, you confirm that you
      are at least 18 years of age. We do not knowingly collect information from children.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
    <p>
      In its current demo form, SuiteMeet does not rely on external analytics or advertising
      SDKs. If future versions integrate third-party services, this policy will be updated to
      describe what is used and why.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        You can toggle presence sharing on or off at any time in the Nearby screen.
      </li>
      <li>
        You can change your profile visibility (e.g., same hotel only or within radius) from
        the Profile screen.
      </li>
      <li>
        You may reset local profile data from the Settings screen, which clears your profile
        info stored on the device.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the
      “Last updated” date at the top of this page. Continued use of SuiteMeet after changes
      are posted means you accept the revised policy.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Contact</h2>
    <p>
      If you have questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact the developer through
      the app store listing or the GitHub repository where this policy is hosted.
