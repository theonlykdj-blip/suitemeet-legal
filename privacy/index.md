# SuiteMeet – Privacy Policy
**Effective Date: November 2025**

This Privacy Policy explains how SuiteMeet (“the App”) handles your information.

SuiteMeet is designed to help hotel guests discover and connect with other nearby travelers. The App is operated by:

**Owner:** Kevin D. James  
**Contact:** theonlykdj@gmail.com  

By using SuiteMeet, you agree to this Privacy Policy.

## 1. Information We Collect

### 1.1 Information You Provide
When you use SuiteMeet, you may provide:

- **Profile information** – name, short bio, visibility preferences  
- **Profile photo** – if you choose to add one  
- **Radius settings** – how far you want to be visible to others  
- **Messages** – content of conversations you send using the App  

All of this is **stored locally on your device**. SuiteMeet does **not** operate a cloud backend for chat or profiles.

---

### 1.2 Location Information
With your permission, SuiteMeet may access your approximate location to:

- Show nearby demo hotels  
- Calculate distances (for example, “2.3 miles away”)  
- Determine who appears within your chosen visibility radius  

Location is used while the App is in use and is **not** stored on a remote server by SuiteMeet.

You can turn off location access at any time in your device settings, but some features may not work as intended.

---

### 1.3 Device Information
The App may access limited technical information such as:

- App version  
- Device type and operating system  

This is used to improve stability and user experience. We do **not** use this information to personally identify you.

---

## 2. How Information Is Stored

SuiteMeet is designed to store data **locally on your device**, including:

- Profile data (name, bio, visibility, photo)  
- Your selected visibility radius  
- Message history  

We do not run a central server that stores your profile or messages.

If you uninstall the App or clear local data from the App settings, the locally stored information will be removed from that device.

---

## 3. How Information Is Used

We use your information to:

- Show your profile to other SuiteMeet users according to your visibility settings  
- Display nearby users within your chosen radius  
- Enable messaging between users  
- Maintain your preferences (e.g., radius, presence sharing)  

We do **not** sell your personal information.

---

## 4. Sharing of Information

Because SuiteMeet does not operate a cloud backend for profiles or chat, we do not “share” your information with third parties in the traditional sense.

However, **other users may see**:

- Your chosen display name  
- Your bio  
- Your approximate distance  
- Your visibility state (“Same hotel”, “Within radius”)  

You control this via your visibility and presence settings.

---

## 5. Your Choices and Controls

You can:

- **Turn presence sharing on or off** at any time  
- Choose between **“Same hotel only,” “Within radius,” or “Private”** visibility  
- Clear local profile data using the “Reset local profile data” option in Settings  
- Disable location access in your device settings  

When presence sharing is off, you are not visible to other users.

---

## 6. Data Retention

Data remains on your device until:

- You clear it using the in-app reset option, or  
- You uninstall the App  

We do not maintain a separate server-side copy of your messages or profile.

---

## 7. Children’s Privacy

SuiteMeet is intended for users **18 years of age or older**.  
We do not knowingly collect information from children under 18. If you believe a user under 18 is using the App, please contact us at **theonlykdj@gmail.com**.

---

## 8. Security

Because data is stored locally on your device, you should:

- Use a passcode or biometric lock on your device  
- Not share your device with people you do not trust  

We use reasonable measures inside the App to protect data, but no system is completely secure.

---

## 9. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will update the “Effective Date” at the top of this page. Continued use of SuiteMeet after changes means you accept the updated Policy.
